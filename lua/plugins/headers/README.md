This is an instruction to create a new alpha header. Copy the following Lua code of this file into a new file in the 
`lua/plugins/headers` directory. Name the file after the module you are creating the header for. For example, 
if you are creating a `demo` header, name the file `demo.lua`. And, require it in `alpha.lua`

```lua
local M = {}

function M.hl()
    return {}
end

function M.header()
  return {}
end

return M
```

The highlighted text and header text could be generated by [img2art](https://github.com/Asthestarsfalll/img2art)
